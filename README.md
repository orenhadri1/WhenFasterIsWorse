# When Faster Is Worse: Time-Based Metrics Fail Under Energy Constraints

**Author:** Oren Hadri  
**Type:** Position paper / preprint

## Abstract
Execution time is widely used as a proxy for efficiency.
This paper shows that under power-dependent execution policies,
execution time does not preserve ordering with respect to energy consumption.
